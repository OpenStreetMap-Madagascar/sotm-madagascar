First there were DJs and VJs. Enter the MJ (map jockey).

Carto-OSC leverages open source libraries, data, and protocols to activate performance spaces – theaters, galleries, nightclubs – with projected, real time cartography. The Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol couples with a touch surface to control layer coloring and patterning, zoom/pitch/bearing effects, label typography, transits along road networks, and a variety of transitions purloined from cinema and visual music.

Written in modern JavaScript, Carto-OSC would be unthinkable without a foundation of Open Stage Control, MapLibre, chroma.js, and OpenStreetMap data. This presentation describes its architecture, the impulses behind its creation, and includes documentation of its use in performance.
