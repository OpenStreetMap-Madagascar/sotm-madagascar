We want to show OSM community our approach and how we focus on checking the data license before ingesting it. We aim at doing partnerships with OSM communities, particularly in Africa where we are planning our next efforts.
In all South America, we are in contact with governments at high level, evangelizing them on OpenStreetMap and the importance of Open Data, helping them to choose the CC0 license for their open data and helping them to publish address data which they sometimes have but do not publish. We also enter in contact with City Halls, utility companies, inviting them to publish in the public domain their address data.

Our data is organized in 3 different DB: 

1 – Preserved data
The data is made available for download as we receive it (Shapefile, CSV, DWG, Orthophotos) with the license description. Our compromise is to maintain the data available for 20 years

2 – Filtered data
Focused on addresses, we create one DB which gathers all address data available. In this filtered DB, and address may appear several times as these may come from different donors.

3 - Consolidated data
In this DB we choose the address we consider the best, according to our ranking.
