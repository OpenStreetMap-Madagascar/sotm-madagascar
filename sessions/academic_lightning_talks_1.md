The following lighting talks are presented in this session of the academic track:

## [The cell size issue in OpenStreetMap data quality parameter analyses: an interpolation-based approach](/sessions/9HBH3X)
### Silvana Philippi Camboim (UFPR)<br>Caio Dos Anjos Paiva (UFPR)<br>Marcio Augusto Reolon Schmidt (UFPR)<br>Elias Nasr Naim Elias (UFPR)<br>Everton Bortolini (UFPR)<br>Guilherme Silva Neivas (UFPR)

The quality of OSM data is dependent on many different factors and is quite heterogeneous. Therefore, in both intrinsic and extrinsic quality parameter analyses, a common practice is subdividing the study areas into subareas. In this paper, we worked on a method for obtaining the optimal grid cell size for OSM data quality analysis. Furthermore, we proposed that if the quality is homogeneous in a region, it can be estimated using an IDW interpolation. . In this summary, we have done a preliminary analysis for a Brazilian city, Curitiba, with about 28,000 points of known accuracy.

## [Inequalities in the completeness of OpenStreetMap buildings in urban centers](/sessions/GPMSLW)
### Benjamin Herfort (HeiGIT)

Albeit the manifold usage of OSM building footprints an adequate investigation into their completeness on the global scale has not been conducted so far. This talk investigates OSM building completeness within all 13,135 urban centers covering about 50% of the global population.

## [Investigating the capability of UAV imagery in AI-assisted mapping of Refugee Camps in East Africa](/sessions/FRJXCQ)
### Christopher Yan-Chak Chan (Institute of Geography and Geology, Julius Maximilians University of Würzburg)<br>Matthias Weigand (German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD), German Aerospace Center (DLR))<br>Emran Alchikh Alnajar (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap)<br>Hannes Taubenböck (Institute of Geography and Geology, Julius Maximilians University of Würzburg & German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD), German Aerospace Center (DLR))

This pilot project is connected to a larger initiative to open-source the assisted mapping platform for Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOTOSM) based on Very High Resolution (VHR) drone imagery. The study test and evaluate multiple U-Net based architectures on building segmentation of Refugee Camps in East Africa.

## [Corporate editing and its impact on network navigability within OpenStreetMap](/sessions/EZPVPB)
### Corey Dickinson (Mcgill University, Geography)<br>Jugal Patel (Mcgill University, Geography)<br>Dipto Sarkar (Carlton University, Geography)

Using intrinsic quality indicators we explore how network quality, in terms of its suitability for navigation, varies across areas with relatively high and low corporate editing in OpenSteetMap. Our work shows areas with relatively high rates of corporate editing exhibit not only an overall increase in data quality, but also increased rates at which quality improves.

## [Returning the favor - Leveraging quality insights of OpenStreetMap-based land-use/land-cover multi-label modeling to the community](/sessions/EKEZ7R)
### Moritz Schott (Institute of Geography, GIScience, Heidelberg University)<br>Adina Zell (Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Remote Sensing Image Analysis Group, Technische Universität Berlin)<br>Sven Lautenbach (Institute of Geography, GIScience, Heidelberg University)<br>Begüm Demir (Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Remote Sensing Image Analysis Group, Technische Universität Berlin)<br>Alexander Zipf (Institute of Geography, GIScience, Heidelberg University)

The fitness of OSM for multi-label classification is proven. A workflow to enhance OSM-based multi-labels using machine learning is established. The results are provided to the OSM community via the HOT Tasking Manager.
