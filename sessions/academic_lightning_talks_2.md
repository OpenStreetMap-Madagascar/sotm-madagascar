The following lighting talks are presented in this session of the academic track:

## [Combining Volunteered Geographic Information and WPdx standards to Improve Mapping of Rural Water Infrastructure in Uganda.](/sessions/JNCVKY)
### Stellamaris Nakacwa (Department of Geology and Geography, West Virginia University)<br>Brent McCusker (Department of Geology and Geography, West Virginia University)<br>Courtney Clark (Everywhere She Maps, YouthMappers)<br>Katy Sill (Water Point Data Exchange, Global Water Challenge)<br>Rory Nealon (USAID GeoCentre)

The lack of data on the distribution of the water resources, possess a great challenge for the water resource investment and AI/ML-enabled advancements in the water sector compared to all other sectors like heath. This paper describes the methodology for combining different water mapping schemas to create comprehensive multi-platform water infrastructure data and enhance rapid updates to support a suite of water resource analytics and extended advanced technology explorations towards improved decision-making.

## [Floor plan extraction from digital building models](/sessions/ZUXTN8)
### Helga Tauscher (Bauhaus-Universität Weimar)

As part of a larger endeavour to make floor plan representations from building models available for indoor map and navigation services, we study the integration of  IFC and OSM.

## [Leveraging OpenStreetMap to investigate urban accessibility and safety of visually impaired pedestrians](/sessions/MXS9R8)
### Achituv Cohen (University of California, Santa Barbara)<br>Asya Natapov (Loughborough University)<br>Sagi Dalyot (The Technion)

Cities worldwide encourage urban active mobility by advocating policy and planning. Although contribution is evident, in practice, these actions disregard population parts that have mobility impairments. This research suggests using OpenStreetMap data in customized analytical models to assess the accessibility level of the urban environment for visually impaired pedestrians. Models results show the existence and spatial distribution of existing accessibility problems, including challenging street network connectivity and dangerous walking areas. These models can be used to enable decision makers, city stakeholders and practitioners to enrich management, monitoring and development of their cities, and support sustainable, livable lifestyles and walkability equality.

## [Understanding and modelling accessibility to public green in large urban centers using OpenStreetMap data](/sessions/TA9VAF)
### Alice Battiston (University of Turin)<br>Rossano Schifanella (Univeristy of Turin and ISI Foundation)

OpenStreetMap data represents a valuable source of information for public green areas in large urban centers and effectively measures the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11.7. Our study provides a threefold contribution in this direction. First, we validate land-use-related tags in OpenStreetMap, through a comparison with satellite data from the European Urban Atlas. We then propose a framework and an interactive tool to measure access to public green areas through several established indices. Finally, we show how the framework can be used to simulate the impact of new green areas and help policymakers design effective interventions.

## [OpenStreetMap as a tool for skill building](/sessions/HSSWBD)
### Aishworya Shrestha (Research Assistant, Kathmandu Living Labs)<br>Nama Budhathoki (Founder and Chair, Kathmandu Living Labs​)<br>Nancy Erbstein (Senior Research Associate, Institute for Global Health and Faculty of Pop Health Sciences, University of California, Davis)

This talk explores the effects of OpenStreetMapping on the mappers. These effects also infer that OSM mapping can be used as a tool for skill-building.
